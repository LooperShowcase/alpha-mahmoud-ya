<p><h2>how do they communite</h2></p>
<h3>As a highly social species, crows use a wide range of vocalizations—caws, rattles, clicks, patterns, and coos—to stay in constant contact with one another. They're superb mimics and can copy a vast repertoire of sounds. Context is everything when deciphering crow language.</h3>

<p><h2>how do crows build their nastes and raise their babies</h2>
<h3>Crows typically hide their nests in a crotch near the trunk of a tree or on a horizontal branch, generally towards the top third or quarter of the tree. They prefer to nest in evergreens, but will nest in deciduous trees when evergreens are less available. Nests can be 50cm or more wide, large than the birds are long!</h3></p>
